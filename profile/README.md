The Hard-to-Reach Population Methods Research Group (HPMRG) focuses on developing statistical methodology to help improve understanding of hard-to-reach or otherwise "hidden" populations. <img src="https://github.com/HPMRG/.github/blob/main/profile/defenseplot5.jpg" align="right" width="250" height="250" alt="RDS network"/>

These populations are characterized by the difficulty in survey sampling from them using standard probability methods. Typically, a sampling frame for the target population is not available, and its members are rare or stigmatized in the larger population so that it is prohibitively expensive to contact them through the available frames. Examples of such populations in a behavioral and social setting include injection drug users, men who have sex with men, and female sex workers. Examples in an economic setting include unregulated workers and the self-employed. Hard-to-reach populations in the US and elsewhere are under-served by current sampling methodologies mainly due to the lack of practical alternatives to address these methodological difficulties.
